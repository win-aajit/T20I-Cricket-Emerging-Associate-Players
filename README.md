# T20I-Cricket-Emerging-Associate-Players
This is an analysis on the best up-and-coming cricketers from Associate Nations (Not Full Member Nations)

I gathered my data from ESPN Cricinfo's StatGuru Database, filtering by Associate Nations since T20I Status was given to all international T20s on January 1st, 2019.

After transfering the data into a csv file through excel, I imported the data into MySQL.

Using the equations provided by https://www.krick3r.com/2016/02/t20-performance-impact-method.html, I ran an equation to find the players with the highest impact perfomance scores
